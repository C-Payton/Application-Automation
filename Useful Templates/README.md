# Application-Automation - Useful Templates
Various code templates for application packaging methods I have developed, refined, or found useful. 

### General Dependencies
Unless noted, all hosted code is targeted to support Windows 10 OS.

* Windows 10 Enterprise (Likely all versions, but currently only testing 20H2 and 21H2)
* Windows 11 (likely works but not tested)
* Windows Server 2012+
* Powershell 5.0+  
* [PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit)
